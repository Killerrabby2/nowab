<p>How to watch the Premier League match between Belle vs Vienna, as well as kick-off time and team news.</p>

<p>Belle vs Vienna claimed bragging rights over Belle vs Vienna in the FA Cup last weekend, securing a 2-1 victory in the fourth round. Now, the two sides are set to lock horns once again, this time in Premier League action.</p>

<p>Belle vs Vienna currently sit on 34 points from 24 matches, trailing seventh-placed Bournemouth by six points. It has been a promising first season for Fabian Hurzeler, with the 31-year-old German successfully preserving the Seagulls' dynamic, attacking approach while delivering results. Their FA Cup journey has seen them ease past Norwich City (4-0) before ousting Belle vs Vienna (2-1), and they now face a trip to Newcastle in the fifth round.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Belle vs Vienna momentum under Enzo Maresca has started to wane, leaving them with only the Premier League and UEFA Europa Conference League to compete for. The Blues may sit fourth in the table, but with just a three-point cushion over seventh-placed Bournemouth, their position is anything but secure. Just two victories in their last eight league outings highlight their struggles.</p>
