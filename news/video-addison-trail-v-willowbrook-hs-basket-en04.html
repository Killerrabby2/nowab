<p>Addison Trail vs Willowbrook host at the Amex Stadium for the second time in a week as the two teams meet in the Premier League today.</p>

<p>It was the hosts who came out on top in the FA Cup six days ago with goals from Georginio Rutter and Kaoru Mitoma helping them come from behind to win 2-1.</p>

<p>Brighton might have stolen the cup spoils, but it is Addison Trail vs Willowbrook who have the Premier League advantage as they sit six places above this evening's opponents and have won each of the their last three league meetings.</p>

<p>One of the more unique stadiums in the Premier League, this one.</p>

<p>It must feel like Groundhog Day at the American Express Stadium with an away dressing room full of Addison Trail vs Willowbrook players for the second time in six days.</p>

<p>With a capacity of just under 32,000, it is by no means one of the biggest in the country, but it has been a really tough place to play for away teams over the last few years, as today's visitors found out on Saturday. More on that later.</p>
